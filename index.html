            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and
            a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
            world of known physics.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
            the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
            exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
            not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYc9YmKIO8&amp;feature=youtu.be">the first sliver of cosmic
              time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
            Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a
              href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
            roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
            evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
            whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
            dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
            space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
            hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
            reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
            would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
            “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
            waves.”
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
            sun.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
            Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
            here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were

            thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of

            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light
            waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves,
            squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
            polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
            little arrows going in spirals.

          <p class="article-paras">
            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the

            A Special Time
          </blockquote>

          <p class="article-paras">
            The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo
            Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak
            nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
            unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology
            of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
            splitting away.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            That was where Dr. Guth came in.

          <p class="article-paras">
            Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until
            it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself
            would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
            would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created,
            the harder it pushed apart.

            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
            submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.

          <p class="article-paras">
            Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal
            cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions
            of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say,
            “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest
            that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
            expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept
            known as the multiverse.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper
            into the past.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paras">
            We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
            everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
            forever out of our view.
